 💡 Recommendations

- **Staff more on Fridays** — it is consistently the busiest day
- **Run promotions in October and February** — the two slowest months
- **Review the bottom 5 pizzas** — consider removing or refreshing them
- **Promote XL and XXL sizes** with group deals — they are currently underutilised
- **Capitalise on the 12 PM and 6 PM rush** — ensure full kitchen capacity at these times
